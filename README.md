ProfessionAI, a company specializing in AI-based automation, wants to develop a software library capable of analyzing and classifying incoming emails. The primary objective is to identify SPAM emails and subsequently conduct in-depth content analysis.

The CEO expressed the need to focus on SPAM emails to better understand associated trends, content, and behaviors. This information will be used to improve the security of corporate communications and refine spam filters.

*Project Objectives*

The CTO provided an email dataset to perform the following tasks:

1. Add a classifier to identify SPAM emails.
2. Identify the main topics among emails classified as SPAM.
3. Calculate the semantic distance between the obtained topics to assess the heterogeneity of SPAM email content.
4. Extract information about the organizations mentioned from NON-SPAM emails.
